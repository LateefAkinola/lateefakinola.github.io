Hello! I started programming when I was a sophomore at the [Federal University of Technology, Akure](https://www.futa.edu.ng/) where I received my BEng in Mechanical Engineering (2016-2023) with [First Class Hons. (4.72/5.00 | 94.4%)](). In 2022, I got selected in the [top 1% of 14000 applicants]() to participate in the [Google Dev Machine Learning BootCamp](https://developers.google.com/). The experience was remarkable and helped built my skills.

My research interest is primarily focused on the [planning](), [learning](), and [intelligent control systems]() of autonomous robots to ensure their [efficient]() and [safe operation]() in [unseen, unstructured, and human-involved environment.]()

My skillset is not limited to this list!
