Hello! I started programming when I was a sophomore at [The Federal University of Technology,  Akure](https://www.futa.edu.ng/) where I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (2016-2023) with a [First Class (94.2% aggregate)]().

I started learning by taking courses via [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and in 2022, I got selected in the [top 2% of 14000 applicants]() to participate in [Google Dev Machine Learning BootCamp](https://developers.google.com/). The experience was remarkable and helped built my skills.

My research interest is primarily focused on the intelligent control systems and mechanisms of autonomous robots to ensure their efficient and safe operation in a human-involved environment.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
