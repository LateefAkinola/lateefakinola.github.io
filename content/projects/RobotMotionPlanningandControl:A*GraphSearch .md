A program that takes two files as input, "nodes.csv and edges.csv", implements A* search to find a minimum-cost path through an undirected graph, and produces a single file as output, "path.csv". The CSV Motion Planning [Kilobot](https://www.kilobotics.com/) CoppeliaSim scene will be used to visualize the graph and the solution path found by the written program.
