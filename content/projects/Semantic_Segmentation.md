In the context of self-driving cars, accurate region-specific labeling is paramount. The objective of this project is to implement U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for rapid and accurate image segmentation. The focus is on predicting a label for every individual pixel in an image, specifically those sourced from a self-driving car dataset.
