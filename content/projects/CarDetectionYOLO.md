As part of a self-driving car project, the focus is on developing a robust car detection system. This part explores the implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, specifically applying it to the domain of car detection. YOLO is chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in scenarios where computational resources for training are limited. The model utilizes pre-trained weights to streamline the object detection process.
