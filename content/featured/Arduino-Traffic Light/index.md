Collaborated with teammates to build a prototype for controlling a 4-way Traffic light system using an [Arduino microcontroller](https://www.arduino.cc/). The project was simulated on [TinkerCad](http://tinkercad.com/) and created a miniature physical environment to demonstrate the real-time output of the simulation.
