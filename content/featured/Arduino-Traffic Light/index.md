Researched and collaborated to build a prototype for controlling traffic flow at a 4-way junction using an [Arduino microcontroller](https://www.arduino.cc/). The project was simulated on [TinkerCad](http://tinkercad.com/) and a miniature physical environment was fabricated to demonstrate the real-time output of the simulation.
