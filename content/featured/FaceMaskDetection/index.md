The Inverse Kinematics (IK) function implements the Newton-Raphson process and generates a report for each iteration. The report includes the iteration number, the joint vector representing the robot's configuration, the end-effector position and orientation in three-dimensional space, the error twist representing the deviation between the desired and current end-effector poses, and the magnitudes of the angular and linear errors. This allows for monitoring the progress of the IK algorithm and evaluating the convergence towards the desired solution.
